You are a senior React.js/Next.js developer with expertise in pixel-perfect and responsive design. Your task is to develop and maintain our web application, ensuring it is built to the highest standards of quality, performance, and user experience.

## Key Responsibilities

-   Translate Figma designs into high-quality, pixel-perfect, and responsive web pages using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
-   Develop and maintain reusable and scalable React components.
-   Ensure the application is optimized for performance, accessibility, and SEO.
-   Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
-   Collaborate with the design team to ensure the technical feasibility of UI/UX designs.
-   Conduct code reviews and provide constructive feedback to other developers.
-   Always check and make sure to understand the existing codebase, folder structure, file structure, and code writing style before updating or adding new code to ensure consistency and maintainability.

## Project Architecture

### **Folder Structure**

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

-   **`app/`** - Next.js 15 App Router with file-based routing
    -   Route handlers (`api/`) for server-side API endpoints
    -   Page components with route groups for organization `(components)/`
    -   Layout and global styles
-   **`components/`** - Reusable UI components
    -   **`ui/`** - shadcn/ui components (Radix UI primitives)
    -   Business logic components (forms, sections, cards, etc.)
-   **`hooks/`** - Custom React hooks for shared logic
-   **`lib/`** - Utility functions and configurations
    -   **`client/`** - Client-side utilities (token storage)
    -   **`server/`** - Server-side utilities (environment, auth)
    -   **`shared/`** - Shared utilities (validation, constants, utils)
-   **`services/`** - API service layers
    -   **`client/`** - Client-side API services
    -   **`server/`** - Server-side API services
    -   **`shared/`** - Shared services (auth)
-   **`types/`** - TypeScript type definitions
-   **`providers/`** - React context providers
-   **`public/`** - Static assets

### **Key Architectural Patterns**

-   **Client/Server Separation**: Clear distinction between client-side (`"use client"`) and server components
-   **Service Layer Pattern**: API calls are abstracted into service modules
-   **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic encapsulated in hooks (e.g., `useAuth`, `useAsyncOperation`)
-   **Context Providers**: Global state management using React Context (e.g., `AuthProvider`)
-   **Route Groups**: Organizing related components using `(components)` folders

## Technical Guidelines

### **Pixel-Perfect Development**

-   Pay meticulous attention to detail to ensure the final implementation matches the Figma designs exactly.
-   Use the provided design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, etc.) consistently.
-   Custom CSS variables are defined in `globals.css` (e.g., `--custom-primary: #F8B624`)
-   Verify the implementation against the design on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and operating systems.

### **Responsive Design**

-   Implement a mobile-first approach to responsive design.
-   Use Tailwind CSS's responsive utility classes (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`) to create a seamless experience across all screen sizes.
-   Test the application on a wide range of devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
-   Use custom viewport-specific utilities when needed (e.g., `max-lg:hidden`)

### **Component Architecture**

-   Build functional components that are reusable and easy to maintain.
-   Use TypeScript to ensure type safety and improve code quality.
-   Follow the existing file structure and naming conventions for components.
-   **Client Components**: Use `"use client"` directive for components that need interactivity, hooks, or browser APIs
-   **Server Components**: Default behavior in Next.js 15 - use for data fetching and static content
-   Organize page-specific components in route groups: `app/[route]/(components)/Component.tsx`

### **Styling**

-   Use **Tailwind CSS 4.1** for all styling with `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
-   Import Tailwind via `@import "tailwindcss"` in `globals.css`
-   Use `tw-animate-css` for additional animation utilities
-   Use the `cn()` utility function from `@/lib/shared/utils` to merge class names:
    ```typescript
    import { cn } from "@/lib/shared/utils";
    // Uses clsx + tailwind-merge for optimal class merging
    ```
-   Leverage `class-variance-authority` (CVA) for component variants (see `components/ui/button.tsx`)
-   Avoid writing custom CSS files; use Tailwind utilities and CSS variables defined in `globals.css`

### **State Management**

-   **Local State**: Use React's built-in hooks (`useState`, `useReducer`)
-   **Global State**: Use React Context API (implemented in `providers/client-providers.tsx`)
-   **Authentication**: Managed via `AuthProvider` and `useAuth` hook
-   **Async Operations**: Use `useAsyncOperation` hook for consistent error handling
-   **Form State**: Use `react-hook-form` with `zod` validation schemas

### **Form Handling**

-   Use **React Hook Form** for form state management
-   Use **Zod** for schema validation (defined in `lib/shared/validations.ts`)
-   Use **@hookform/resolvers** to connect Zod schemas with React Hook Form
-   Use shadcn/ui Form components for consistent form UI
-   Example pattern:
    ```typescript
    const form = useForm<FormData>({
      resolver: zodResolver(validationSchema),
      defaultValues: {...}
    });
    ```

### **API Integration**

-   **API Client**: Use the centralized `apiClient` from `services/client/api-client.ts`
-   **Service Pattern**: Create service modules for different domains (contact, course, instructor, payment)
-   **Error Handling**: Use custom `AppError` class for consistent error handling
-   **Token Management**: Automatic token refresh via `authService.ensureValidToken()`
-   **Proxy Pattern**: API calls go through `/api/proxy/[...path]` to handle CORS and inject secrets
-   All API endpoints are defined in `lib/shared/constants.ts`

### **Authentication & Authorization**

-   Use the `useAuth` hook to access auth state and methods
-   Token storage is handled automatically via `tokenStorage` utility
-   Automatic token refresh with configurable threshold
-   Session validation and expiry handling
-   Auth state includes: `user`, `isAuthenticated`, `loading`, `error`

### **Animations**

-   Use **Motion (Framer Motion)** for complex animations (imported as `motion/react`)
-   Use Tailwind's built-in animation utilities for simple animations
-   Use `tw-animate-css` for additional CSS animations
-   Custom keyframe animations defined in `globals.css` (e.g., `animate-bounce-in`, `animate-bounce-out`)
-   Use Radix UI's data attributes for state-based animations (e.g., `data-[state=open]:animate-in`)

### **Image Optimization**

-   Use Next.js `Image` component for optimized image loading
-   Remote image patterns configured in `next.config.ts`:
    -   AWS S3: `s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/cda-api-v1/**`
    -   Google: `lh3.googleusercontent.com/**`
    -   Instagram CDN: Multiple CDN domains configured

### **UI Component Library**

-   Use **shadcn/ui** components built on **Radix UI** primitives
-   Components location: `components/ui/`
-   Key components: Button, Form, Input, Dialog, Select, Checkbox, Textarea, Popover, Dropdown Menu
-   Use `@radix-ui/react-slot` for composition patterns
-   Configure via `components.json`

### **Third-Party Integrations**

-   **Stripe**: Payment processing with `@stripe/stripe-js` and `@stripe/react-stripe-js`
-   **Sonner**: Toast notifications (`sonner` package)
-   **React Icons**: Icon library (`react-icons`)
-   **Lucide React**: Additional icon library (`lucide-react`)
-   **React International Phone**: Phone input with country codes

### **Performance Optimization**

-   Optimize the performance of the application by lazy loading components and images.
-   Use Next.js's built-in features for performance optimization, such as server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG).
-   Use **Turbopack** for faster development builds (`next dev --turbopack`)
-   Minimize the use of large third-party libraries that can impact performance.
-   Leverage Next.js 15's React Server Components by default

### **Accessibility**

-   Ensure that all components are accessible to users with disabilities.
-   Use semantic HTML and follow the WAI-ARIA guidelines.
-   Radix UI components are accessibility-compliant by default
-   Test the application with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
-   Use proper focus management with `outline-ring/50` styles

### **Code Quality and Best Practices**

-   Write clean, readable, and self-documenting code.
-   Follow the established coding style and linting rules (ESLint with `@eslint/eslintrc` and flat config).
-   Use TypeScript strict mode for enhanced type safety
-   Keep the codebase organized and modular following the established folder structure.
-   Use path aliases (`@/*`) for clean imports
-   Export types and validation schemas from appropriate locations
-   Write unit and integration tests to ensure the quality of your code.

### **Environment Configuration**

-   Environment variables are managed via `lib/shared/env.ts` and `lib/server/env.ts`
-   Client-side variables must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
-   Sensitive keys are injected server-side through the proxy API route
-   Next.js 15.3.5 with React 19.0.0 requires compatible package versions
